Background:

Imagine you’re working with a Product Manager and s/he realizes that the customer would be better served by introducing the concept of “templating” based on Use Cases.  S/he gives you the following wireframe to develop. 
Task:

Implement a working prototype of the attached wireframe (using JavaScript.) Feel free to use plain JavaScript or, if you prefer, a contemporary JS MVC of your choosing (be prepared to justify your choice.) See “Assets” below for images assets.
Estimated duration: 2 hrs
Interactions:

‘see more’ on the landing page should be a link that, when clicked, reveals two other Use Cases: ‘Content Moderation’ and ‘Start from Scratch’ (see images)
for the “Don’t see what you’re looking for?” textarea, ensure the following:
leverage whatever you want for attaching a file for “Upload file”
the Send button should be disabled by default
the Send button will be enabled when the user enters text in the textarea, unless more than a maximum of 140 characters have been added, in which case the Send button is disabled and the user is shown an error message
add interaction for AJAX requests, both success and failure; in either case, display an appropriate message to the user

Assumptions:

model the Use Cases (e.g. ‘Sentiment Analysis,’ ‘Search Relevance Tuning’, etc.) using a static JSON blob
What we’re looking for:

clean, well-structured code
attention-to-detail in styling
tests where appropriate
